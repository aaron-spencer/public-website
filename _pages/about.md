# About Me

I have spent almost the entirety of my career designing and building IT infrastructure for medium to large businesses. Currently, I lead teams supporting cloud and network infrastructure, along with network security and automation.

However, I have spend a good portion of my free time over the last handful of years learning and developing mobile apps for iOS. This website provides information and opportunities for users of my apps to comment and leave feedback.

## Contact

The best way to leave feedback on my apps is to use the comments feature on the app page, or on any post about that app. If you want to reach out to me personally, please use the Linked-In in bio.
