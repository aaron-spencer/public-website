The privacy policy for all apps created by me is very simple: I collect no data from you, the user, or from your device. None of your personal data is needed for any current app to function, so there is no need for me to ask for it, or for you to provide it.

## Notification of Changes

If this policy changes in the future, new app terms will be updated and presented to you in app, and this page will be updated.
