While my previous website hosting worked fine, I have decided to move it to a place where I have a bit more control over how the site is constructed. It is now using Github pages, which has taken a little while to get used to, but seems to be pretty flexible and generally free!

## Work in progress

This website is still a work in progress, but it still progress nonetheless! You will still find links to important resources, such as app descriptions and links to download from the App Store.

More to come!
