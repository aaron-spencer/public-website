# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Jekyll. Jekyll is an amazing static site generator that makes it easy to create websites.

## Why Jekyll?

- **Simple**: Write in Markdown
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll natively
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize

## Getting Started

You can write posts in Markdown and Jekyll will automatically convert them to HTML. Here's some example Markdown syntax:

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Links and Images

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more info.

Stay tuned for more posts!
